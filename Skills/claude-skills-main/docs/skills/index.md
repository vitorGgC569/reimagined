## Python Tools Distribution

```mermaid
pie title 250 Python Tools by Domain
    "Marketing" : 32
    "Engineering Core" : 30
    "Engineering POWERFUL" : 25
    "Project Management" : 12
    "Product" : 9
    "Business & Growth" : 9
    "Finance" : 7
    "Other" : 126
```

!!! tip "All tools are stdlib-only"
    Every Python script uses only the standard library — zero `pip install` required. All 250 tools are verified passing `--help`. Scripts support both human-readable and `--json` output for automation.

## How Skills Work

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-numeric-1-circle:{ .lg .middle } **Install**

    ---

    Add a skill bundle or individual skill via the plugin marketplace.

    ```bash
    /plugin install engineering-skills@claude-code-skills
    ```

-   :material-numeric-2-circle:{ .lg .middle } **Trigger**

    ---

    Skills activate automatically when your prompt matches their domain — or invoke directly.

-   :material-numeric-3-circle:{ .lg .middle } **Execute**

    ---

    The agent follows SKILL.md workflows, runs Python tools for analysis, and references expert knowledge bases.

-   :material-numeric-4-circle:{ .lg .middle } **Output**

    ---

    Get structured, actionable results — reports, code, configurations, strategies, or documentation.
